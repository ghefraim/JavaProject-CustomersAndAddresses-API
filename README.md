# Java Lab Project: Customer and Address Entity Relationship
This repository contains Efraim Ghiurau's (IT) project for the Java laboratory.
Requirement: Create a new entity that can be accessed through CRUD commands.
I have created 2 entities with a relationship between them (one-to-one relationship): Customer and Address (the residential address of a Customer).
